## Fine-Tune RunwayML's Stable Diffusion v1-5 with LoRA - Google Colab

This directory contains the Colab Notebook `finetune_colab_gpu.ipynb` for fine-tuning a stable diffusion model using the LoRA technique. 

**Cost-Effective Fine-Tuning:**

This approach utilizes Google Colab Pro's T4 GPU option, significantly reducing the cost compared to deploying a GPU-enabled AWS machine. 



**Additional Information:**

- The LoRA technique allows for efficient fine-tuning of large models like Stable Diffusion with a smaller dataset.
- For detailed information about LoRA, refer to the LoRA: Locally Reparameterized Adaptation for Fine-tuning Large Language Models: [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11957](https://huggingface.co/papers/2106.09685)) paper.
