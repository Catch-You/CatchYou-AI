# Criminal composite Sketch Image Editing with Prompt-to-Prompt

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file `prompt2prompt.ipynb` that explores the integration of Google's Prompt-to-Prompt technique for image editing with the `SujinHwang/criminal-sketch-lora-v2-2` model from Hugging Face, which is trained on criminal sketch data. 

The Prompt-to-Prompt technique allows for modifying existing images by providing a text prompt that describes the desired changes. The notebook attempts to apply this technique to the criminal sketch model, which could potentially be useful for enhancing or refining existing sketch images.


## Model Information

The `SujinHwang/criminal-sketch-lora-v2-2` model is a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model trained on criminal sketch data. It can be used for generating or manipulating criminal sketch-style images.
