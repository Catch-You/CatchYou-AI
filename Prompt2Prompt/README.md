# Criminal composite Sketch Image Editing with Prompt-to-Prompt

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file `prompt_to_prompt_lora.ipynb` that demonstrates the use of Google's Prompt-to-Prompt technique for image editing. Specifically, it evaluates the effectiveness of this technique when applied to the `SujinHwang/criminal-sketch-lora-v2-2` model from Hugging Face, which is trained on criminal sketch data.

The Prompt-to-Prompt technique allows for modifying existing images by providing a text prompt that describes the desired changes. This can be useful for various applications, such as enhancing or refining existing images.

## Model Information

The `SujinHwang/criminal-sketch-lora-v2-2` model is a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model trained on criminal sketch data. It can be used for generating or manipulating criminal sketch-style images.
